# Open Closed principle

This program supports a chain of supermarkets. When checking out a correct price needs to be calculated. 

A supermarket can also run promotions. Currently only the "SPECIAL" promotion is implemented. The previous developer has fallen ill and you are tasked to take over. You need to support the promotion type "Buy 4 get one free". The previous developer has already written a couple of tests, make sure they are all green. Apart from implementing this feature, you should also clean up the code.
